# ft_linear_regression

## Guidelines / Instructions from the subject

> The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.
> For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) train with a [gradient descent algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).

> In this project you are free to use whatever language you want.
>
> - You are also free to use any libraries you want as long as they do not do all the work for you. For example, the use of pythonâ€™s numpy.polyfit is considered cheating.
> - You should use a language that allows you to easily visualize your data : it will be very helpful for debugging.

A logical choice is thus **Python**.
